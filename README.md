# pureblack for beeper

an all black theme for [beeper](https://www.beeper.com/)
largely based on the [metrology](https://github.com/Madelena/Metrology-for-Beeper/tree/main) theme


# installation
1. copy the [the raw css code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Madelena/Metrology-for-Beeper/main/Metrology-for-Beeper.css)
2. paste it into the Custom CSS box at the bottom of Settings > Appearance
3. hit “Apply”
4. continue to hit “Apply” button each time the app restarts

# notes
- this theme does not change the settings panel, except for the font
- all themes reset when beeper restarts to avoid potential issues
- i would be happy to make small alterations to this theme if requested
- i can also post a short how-to if you’re interested in making larger changes

# known issues
- i have not found a way to make the reply boxes for outgoing messages the same color as the reply boxes for incoming messages, and help would be appreciated
